# Projet informations

This project's purpose is purely for test and learn solidity stuff.

In this project we wanted to create a Lottery, what we want here :

1. Users can enter lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
2. An Admin can choose when the lottery is over
3. The lottery will select a random winner

# How do we want to test ?

1. `forked-mainnet` Because we only work on chain and math
2. `development` with mocks
3. `testnet`
